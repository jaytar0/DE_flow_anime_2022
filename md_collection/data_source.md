# Data Sources

The datasource used for this project was from kaggle [Anime DataSet 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalmane10/anime-dataset-2022) uploaded by [Vishal Mane](). The author has webscraped official data from [anime-planet](https://www.anime-planet.com/) a popular anime media site.


I have thought about scraping for the data myself on several occassions as that is something I'm definitely familiar with doing. However, due to the project scope, time-limit, and what I preferred to showcase, I will not be doing that here.

## Steps
We will be working with the python [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) to request our data.

1. Create an account with Kaggle.
2. Collect the correct credentials.
3. Using the docs provide the correct usage in your scripts.

More details can be found in the the ```/airflow/data_retrieval``` directory.
