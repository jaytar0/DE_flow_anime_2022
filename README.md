# DE_flow_anime_2022
As anime was one of my favorite childhoood/early years pass times, it was definitely one of the topics that I have been wanting to analyze for a while now. This project shows an end to end Data Engineering project on japanese animation data (collected as of 2022), to derive interesting insights of the genreal trends surrounding anime and more focused analytical views within sub categories of the data.
